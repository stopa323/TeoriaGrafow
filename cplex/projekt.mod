# TODOs:
  * Objective function:
    - add students preferences (optional)
  * Constraints:
    - class has to be assigned to continuous set of slots, situation when 30 min
      class is split into two slots e.g. 8:30-8:45, 10:00-10:15 is forbidden
    - only one class can be assigned to the room in a given time -  DONE
    - only one class can be assigned to the teacher in a given time - DONE
    - table, computer, swimming pool requirements - DONE
  * Constraints or obj function, not sure, but obj func most likely:
    - min/max break for the teacher (optional)
    - max class slots in row for the teacher (optional)
